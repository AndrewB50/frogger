# frogger
Basic rendition of the classic Frogger video game. Created using Visual Studio 2017 and MonoGame.
Please forgive the poorly named files. Frogger-Finished.cs is the zipped folder available to you to open and run the game through Visual Studio. However, if you are not comfortable doing that, I left the code available in individual files for you to review and/or copy and paste if you'd like. Game1.cs is the main file, the rest are classes that it pulls from.
